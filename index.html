		<h1>About Dustin</h1>
		<h3>Born in an Apple Bin</h3>
		<p>Not really. I was born in Yakima and raised in East Wenatchee in an apple orchard. I got my very own PC when I was 10. and it's power supply failed two days later.</p>

		<h3>Journey to the East</h3>
		<p>In 2004 my parents and I moved to Spokane where I started high school. I Was aimless.</p>

		<h3>Creation</h3>
		<p>I started playing Minecraft while looking for a new game to play with my friend Alex. Later I became part of a gaming community. Soon, that community needed a new safe place to play, so I created a new server for them to play on.</p>
		<p>Eventually I needed to stop relying on developers so I taught myself to write features for my server. Small features came first, larger ones later on. Eventually I had created quite a lot of code and decided i should put my skills to better use.</p>

		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>While I worked on building my skillset, I made a living as a security guard. I worked many different locations from car dealerships to hospitals, construction sites and courthouses. I also lent my skills to IT departments in a couple locations when security related software broke down.</p>
